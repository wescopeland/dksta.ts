	<h3>The Average Game</h3>

		This is a simulation produced on a daily basis calculated from every killscreen entry in the database.
		Each killscreen game has been taken and averaged into a single game: "the average game".
		Every scoring metric of every game has been carefully compiled into this single game: every barrel, pie, spring, rivet,
		death score, and death location. With each new killscreen entry in the database, the average game automatically adjusts itself.

	<h3>The Perfect Game</h3>
	<p>
		This is a simulation produced on a daily basis calculated from every game in the database.
		Each game has been scanned through, and the <em>maximum scores earned on every board</em> have been assembled
		into a single game: "the perfect game". With each new game entry in the database that breaks the maximum score earned
		on a board, the perfect game automatically adjusts itself.
